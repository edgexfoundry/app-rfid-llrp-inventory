# Every device(reader) + antenna port represents a tag location and can be assigned an alias
# such as Freezer, Backroom etc. to give more meaning to the data. The default alias set by
# the application has a format of <deviceName>_<antennaId> e.g. Reader-10-EF-25_1 where
# Reader-10-EF-25 is the deviceName and 1 is the antennaId.
# See also: https://github.com/edgexfoundry/app-rfid-llrp-inventory#setting-the-aliases
#
# In order to override an alias, set the default alias as the key, and the new alias as the value you want, such as:
# Reader-10-EF-25_1 = "Freezer"
# Reader-10-EF-25_2 = "Backroom"
