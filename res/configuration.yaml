AppCustom:
  # Every device(reader) + antenna port represents a tag location and can be assigned an alias
  # such as Freezer, Backroom etc. to give more meaning to the data. The default alias set by
  # the application has a format of <deviceName>_<antennaId> e.g. Reader-10-EF-25_1 where
  # Reader-10-EF-25 is the deviceName and 1 is the antennaId.
  # See also: https://github.com/edgexfoundry/app-rfid-llrp-inventory#setting-the-aliases
  #
  # In order to override an alias, set the default alias as the key, and the new alias as the value you want, such as:
  # Reader-10-EF-25_1: Freezer
  # Reader-10-EF-25_2: Backroom
  Aliases: {}
